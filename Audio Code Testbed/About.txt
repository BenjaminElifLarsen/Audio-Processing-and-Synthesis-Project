--Audio Processing and Synthesis Program--
The APSP... for some of your needs.
Under development. 
Currently, the program can only process wav files encoded using PCM.
All synthesis sounds are stored as wavs.
IP stands for "Implemented Partly". NP stands for "Not Implemented".
Options in any IP menues are fully working, but may lack full control of
parameters and/or optimisations.
Pitch estimation is currently not threaded. It might seem like the program
has crashed, but it is working.
